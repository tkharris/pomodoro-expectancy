# Pomodoro Expectancy

Answers the question that nobody asked: How many pomorodos do I have left in my lifetime?

I've been doing GTD for a while now and use the pomodoro technique for managing the actual chunks of work that are fed into the system. I'm starting to get a decent feel for how many pomodoros it takes to get things done and/or to become an expert in some new technique or discipline and I'm thinking of growth and progress in terms of _x_ pomodoros. Now that I'm getting older I am also thinking not just in terms of what I can do in the next few years, but how much I can do period (i.e. before kicking the bucket). This web app attempts to answer that very question for myself and the potentially non-zero number of other people interested in knowing by computing a time left to live from a few demographic parameters and a pomodoro rate from some other parameters.

## Caveots

There are so many caveots to cover here that the first caveot is that there are probably a lot of cavetots that I haven't thought of. But to list a few...
1. These are averages based on gross demographic data. You current health will no doubt have a major impact, yet we gloss over that.
2. We unrealisticly assume here that you work at the same rate from now until the day you die.

## Ackknowledgements

This site is based on great Medium [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-left-to-live-modeling-life-expectancy-and-prototyping-it-on-the-web-with-flask-and-68e3a8fa0fe4) by Manuel Amunategui. It's really not much different from his original work (yet).
